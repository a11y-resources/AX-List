April 2022: For my bachelor thesis I researched resources for developers about accessibility. Here is my list. It's a work in progress until end of August 2022. Afterwards I will update it if I come across something helpful to add. 

I also am conducting a survey about developers needs. I'll add the results of the survey at end of August 2022 the latest.<br>

Have a look at the list of resources: [IndexPage](.index.html)
