April 2022: For my bachelor thesis I researched resources for developers about accessibility. [Here is my list.](index.md) and here the [GitHubPage](https://a11y-resources.github.io/AX-List/) of it. It's a work in progress until end of August 2022. Afterwards I will update it if I come across something helpful to add. 

I also am conducting a survey about developers needs. I'll add the results of the survey at end of August 2022 the latest.<br>

**Thank you to all who helped me with this survey/thesis!** I could not do it without your participation/support.
